1. O que é TDD?

Test-Driven Development is a developer practice that involves writing tests
before writing the code being tested. Begin by writing a very small test for
code that does not yet exist. Run the test, and, naturally, it fails. Now write
just enough code to make that test pass.

Once the test passes, observe the resulting design, and refactor any duplica-
tion you see. 2 It is natural at this point to judge the design as too simple to
handle all the responsibilities this code will have.

Instead of adding more code, document the next responsibility in the form of
the next test. Run it, watch it fail, write just enough code to get it to pass,
review the design, and remove duplication. Now add the next test, watch it fail, get it to pass, refactor, fail, pass, refactor, fail, pass, refactor, and so on,
and so on.

Rather than thinking of TDD as a testing practice, we see it as a technique
used to deliver high-quality code to testers, who are responsible for formal
testing practices

2. O que é BDD?

BDD puts the focus on behavior instead of structure, and it does so at every
level of development.

Once we acknowledge this, (BDD make) it changes the way we think about driving out
code. We begin to think more about interactions between people and systems,
or between objects, than we do about the structure of the objects.

BDD aims (alvo/objetivo) to help communication by simplifying
the language we use to describe scenarios in which the software will be used:
Given some context, When some event occurs, Then I expect some outcome.

3. O que é Given, When e Then?

Given, When, Then, the BDD triad, are simple words that we use whether
we’re talking about application behavior or object behavior. They are easily
understood by business analysts, testers, and developers alike.

4. O que é Rspec?

RSpec takes a slightly different approach to the idea of testing applications, by testing behavior rather than only specific methods. I thought I’d take some time to show everyone why rspec is so useful in testing your applications.

RSpec is a testing tool for Ruby, created for behavior-driven development (BDD). It is the most frequently used testing library for Ruby in production applications. Even though it has a very rich and powerful DSL (domain-specific language), at its core it is a simple tool which you can start using rather quickly.

RSpec is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for the Ruby programming language, inspired by JBehave.[4] It contains its own mocking framework that is fully integrated into the framework based upon JMock. The framework can be considered a domain-specific language (DSL) and resembles a natural language specification. [Wikipedia]


5. O que é Cucumber?

BDD is a full-stack agile methodology. It takes some of its cues from Extreme Programming, including a variation of Acceptance Test-Driven Development called Acceptance Test-Driven Planning (ATDP).

In ATDP, we use customer acceptance tests to drive the development of code. Ideally, these are the result of a collaborative effort between the customer and the delivery team. Sometimes they are written by the delivery team and then reviewed/approved by the customer. In either case, they are customer facing and must be expressed in a language and format that customers can relate to. Cucumber gives us that language and format.

Cucumber reads plain-text descriptions of application features with example
scenarios and uses the scenario steps to automate interaction with the code
being developed.


6. Como deve ser o ciclo BDD em Rspec?

At each green point in the RSpec cycle, we’ll check the Cucumber cycle. If it
is still red, the resulting feedback should guide us to the next action in the
RSpec cycle. If it is green, we can jump out to Cucumber, refactor if appropri-
ate, and then repeat the cycle by writing a new failing Cucumber step.

7. Which are steps in BDD Cycle?

a) Focus on one scenario;
b) Write failing step definition;
c) Write failing example;
d) Get the example to pass;
e) Refactor;
f) When step is passing, refactor, or else, write failing step again until focus on another scenario;


:: INFORMAÇÕES COMPLEMENTARES ::

-> RSpec and Cucumber help us specify
the behavior of code with examples that are programmatically tied to that
code.

-> We use Cucumber to describe the behavior of applications and use RSpec to
describe the behavior of objects.

-> Both cycles involve taking small steps and listening to the feedback you get
from the tools. We start with a failing step (red) in Cucumber (the outer cycle).
To get that step to pass, we’ll drop down to RSpec (the inner cycle) and drive
out the underlying code at a granular level (red/green/refactor).
